A reusable set of ACF fields and helper functions for countdowns.

== Description ==

Fixel Countdown is a set of fields and helper functions for recurring weekly countdown banners, typically used for live streams. It does not include any frontend output implementation, so you probably should not use unless you're a developer who can create this yourself.
